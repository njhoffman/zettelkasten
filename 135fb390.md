## Portal networks

Captive portal checks

Firefox's captive portal detector tests whether the network connection requires you to log in. This is sometimes the case when using a public Wi-Fi hotspot. Firefox does this by regularly connecting to http://detectportal.firefox.com/canonical.html. Firefox will also make connections to this URL to check if your current network supports certain technologies such as IPv6.
What to do after the captive portal check

If the page was left open by Firefox, you may simply close it.

If this happens frequently please file a Networking bug and describe what happened (requires creating a Bugzilla account).
How captive portals work

A captive portal is what we call a network that requires your action before it allows you to connect to the Internet. This action could be to log in using a username and password, or just to accept the network's terms and conditions.

The way most networks do this is by redirecting you to such a page. Firefox will make automatic connections to detect these redirects. When those happen, you will see a notification indicating that you may need to log into the network. Normally, after you do this, the tab will be closed automatically. Occasionally, it will be kept around to display a message from the network's owners.


## VIM switches and command line arguments

-es           *-es* *-Es* *-s-ex* *silent-mode*
-Es   Silent mode (no UI), for scripting.  Unrelated to |-s|.
    Disables most prompts, messages, warnings and errors.

    -es reads/executes stdin as Ex commands. >
      printf "put ='foo'\n%%print\n" | nvim -es

<   -Es reads stdin as text (into buffer 1).  Use |-c| or "+" to
    send commands. >
      printf "foo\n" | nvim -Es +"%print"

<   Output of these commands is displayed (to stdout):
      :print
      :list
      :number
      :set      (to display option values)
    When 'verbose' is set messages are printed to stderr. >
      echo foo | nvim -V1 -es

<   User |config| is skipped (unless given with |-u|).
    Swap file is skipped (like |-n|).
    User |shada| is loaded (unless "-i NONE" is given).

              *-b*
```sh
--headless  Start without UI, and do not wait for `nvim_ui_attach`. The
    builtin TUI is not used, so stdio works as an arbitrary
    communication channel. |channel-stdio|

    Also useful for scripting (tests) to see messages that would
    not be printed by |-es|.

    To detect if a UI is available, check if |nvim_list_uis()| is
    empty during or after |VimEnter|.

    To read stdin as text, "-" must be given explicitly:
    --headless cannot assume that stdin is just text. >
      echo foo | nvim --headless +"%print" +"q!" -
<
    See also |--embed|.
    See also |-es|, which also disables most messages.

-V[N]   Verbose.  Sets the 'verbose' option to [N] (default: 10).
    Messages will be given for each file that is ":source"d and
    for reading or writing a ShaDa file.  Can be used to find
    out what is happening upon startup and exit.
    Example: >
      nvim -V8

-V[N]{filename}
    Like -V and set 'verbosefile' to {filename}.  Messages are not
    displayed; instead they are written to the file {filename}.
    {filename} must not start with a digit.
    Example: >
      nvim -V20vimlog
<
              *-D*
-D    Debugging.  Go to debugging mode when executing the first
    command from a script. |debug-mode|
