### Extending gpg key

Find the ID of the expiring key, e.g. with gpg --list-secret-keys. Note your key ID (after the slash).
Start editing the key with gpg --edit-key KEY_ID
View your selected key and subkeys with list
Select the primary key with key 0
Interactively select a new expiry with expire. You'll probably have to unlock your key with its passphrase.
Select the primary subkey with key 1 and repeat step 5.
Inspect the resulting expiries with list.
Issue a save when you're done.

```sh
GIT_DIR=$HOME/.cfg GIT_WORK_TREE=$HOME [n]vim
git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg --work-tree=$HOME config --local core.worktree $HOME
# Set core.worktree for your git repository:
git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg --work-tree=$HOME config --local core.worktree $HOME
# You can make sure you get it right with the following command:
git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg --work-tree=$HOME config --local core.worktree
# The output should be your HOME path.
# If you get the git repository by git clone --bare ..., you need to unset core.bare to avoid git status error warning: core.bare and core.worktree do not make sense:
git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg --work-tree=$HOME config --unset core.bare

```

When you copy some text, it goes into a register. The text inside a register has a type: characterwise, linewise or blockwise.

This type determines in which way the text will be put.

In your example, you copied some text from visual block mode. So, the text had the type blockwise and was stored in the unnamed register ".
Because of this type, when you will paste it back inside your buffer, it will be pasted as a block.

If you want to paste it as a sequence of lines, instead of a block, there are 3 ways.

From insert mode, you can insert it by hitting C-r ".
It should insert the contents of the unnamed register as if its type was linewise.
From the command line, you can use the :put command.
:put should paste the text inside a register as if its type was linewise, no matter its original type. Note that you can pass the name of a register as an argument, as well as a line address to specifiy below which line you want the register to be pasted.
For example:

:42put a
... should put the contents of the register a, below the 42th line.

Without a register name, Vim will assume you want to paste the unnamed register (or the + register if you tweaked 'clipboard').
And without an address, Vim will assume you want to paste it below the current line.

From the command line, you can change the type of the unnamed register with the setreg() function:

:call setreg('"', '', 'al')

Here, setreg() should append an empty string to the unnamed register (thanks to the a flag passed as a third argument) and change its type to linewise (thanks to the l flag).

Then, from normal mode, you should be able to paste the register, with the p normal command, as if its type was linewise.

It's not directly linked to your issue, but when you copy some text, it also goes into the 0 register. And if you prepended the value unnamedplus to the option 'clipboard', it also goes into the + register.

You can check what's the type of a register, using the getregtype() function:

:echo getregtype('"')
If it returns a lowercase v, it means the type is characterwise.
If it returns an uppercase V, it means the type is linewise.
If it returns ^V{some number}, it means the type is blockwise, and the width of the block is {some number}.

If you're like me, you occasionally do a linewise yank, and then want to insert that yanked text in the middle of some other line, (or vice versa). This function and mapping will allow you to do a linewise or characterwise paste no matter how you yanked the text.

function! Paste(regname, pasteType, pastecmd)
  let reg_type = getregtype(a:regname)
  call setreg(a:regname, getreg(a:regname), a:pasteType)
  exe 'normal "'.a:regname . a:pastecmd
  call setreg(a:regname, getreg(a:regname), reg_type)
endfunction
nmap <Leader>lP :call Paste(v:register, "l", "P")<CR>
nmap <Leader>lp :call Paste(v:register, "l", "p")<CR>
nmap <Leader>cP :call Paste(v:register, "v", "P")<CR>
nmap <Leader>cp :call Paste(v:register, "v", "p")<CR>
The above will keep newlines inside the register. To additionally join the pasted lines to a stream of characters without any newlines, use this:

function! PasteJointCharacterwise(regname, pastecmd)
  let reg_type = getregtype(a:regname)
  call setreg(a:regname, '', "ac")
  exe 'normal "'.a:regname . a:pastecmd
  call setreg(a:regname, '', "a".reg_type)
  exe 'normal `[v`]J'
endfunction
nmap <Leader>p :call PasteJointCharacterwise(v:register, "p")<CR>
nmap <Leader>P :call PasteJointCharacterwise(v:register, "P")<CR>
Content from VimTip356 (this tip)
Since I didn't want to interfere with the standard Vim mappings I removed all the <C-c>, <C-v>, etc. mappings found in the default vimrc. But quickly copy-pasting text is a must, so I added the following keymaps. This is very simple, but it works like a charm.

vmap <C-Space> "ay
nmap <C-Space> "aP
imap <C-Space> <C-o>"ap
nmap <C-c> "ayiw
Comments
I found the insertion mapping faulty: its behavior depended on whether I was at the end of the line. The following work well for me:

vmap <C-c> "py
nmap <C-c> "pyiw
vmap <C-p> "pp
nmap <C-p> "pP
imap <C-p> <Esc>"ppa

Having replaced Notepad with gvim, these are my preferred editing shortcuts:

" Copy to 'clipboard registry'
vmap <C-c> "*y

" Select all text
nmap <C-a> ggVG
Comments
Have you seen vim70/mswin.vim, it comes with Vim 7.0 (and prior versions). It sets up a bunch of behavior that makes Vim work nice with Windows. Just source it in your vimrc. It's worth reading through for some ideas if you don't want to use the entire thing.

Content from tip 1528 (now removed; content to be merged here)
Easy copy and paste in Vim:

" normal copy/paste
vmap <C-c> y<Esc>i
vmap <C-x> d<Esc>i
imap <C-v> <Esc>pi
imap <C-y> <Esc>ddi
map <C-z> <Esc>
imap <C-z> <Esc>ui
How it works:

Select something in visual mode. Then Ctrl-c (copy), Ctrl-x (cut).

After the operation you are in insert mode. So just navigate to the place where you want to paste and do Ctrl-v

When in insert mode Ctrl-y deletes the current line, Ctrl-z undo last change.

To make interaction with other applications more intuitive, see Easy_pasting_to_Windows_applications.

Todo
Need to state whether this is for a particular operating system. Does it work with the system clipboard? If not, is it useful?

See :help :behave for usage of mswin.vim. Most installs of Vim on Windows use mswin.vim. In that case, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-X, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-Z just behave as a Windows user would expect, and the tip as now written has no point.

If using gvim without mswin.vim (a good idea), look at the Edit menu for the recommended keys.

If wanting the mswin.vim key mappings, is there a reason to use this tip rather than mswin.vim?

## Portal networks

Captive portal checks

Firefox's captive portal detector tests whether the network connection requires you to log in. This is sometimes the case when using a public Wi-Fi hotspot. Firefox does this by regularly connecting to http://detectportal.firefox.com/canonical.html. Firefox will also make connections to this URL to check if your current network supports certain technologies such as IPv6.
What to do after the captive portal check

If the page was left open by Firefox, you may simply close it.

If this happens frequently please file a Networking bug and describe what happened (requires creating a Bugzilla account).
How captive portals work

A captive portal is what we call a network that requires your action before it allows you to connect to the Internet. This action could be to log in using a username and password, or just to accept the network's terms and conditions.

The way most networks do this is by redirecting you to such a page. Firefox will make automatic connections to detect these redirects. When those happen, you will see a notification indicating that you may need to log into the network. Normally, after you do this, the tab will be closed automatically. Occasionally, it will be kept around to display a message from the network's owners.


## VIM switches and command line arguments


```
-es           *-es* *-Es* *-s-ex* *silent-mode*
-Es   Silent mode (no UI), for scripting.  Unrelated to |-s|.
    Disables most prompts, messages, warnings and errors.

    -es reads/executes stdin as Ex commands. >
      printf "put ='foo'\n%%print\n" | nvim -es

<   -Es reads stdin as text (into buffer 1).  Use |-c| or "+" to
    send commands. >
      printf "foo\n" | nvim -Es +"%print"

<   Output of these commands is displayed (to stdout):
      :print
      :list
      :number
      :set      (to display option values)
    When 'verbose' is set messages are printed to stderr. >
      echo foo | nvim -V1 -es

<   User |config| is skipped (unless given with |-u|).
    Swap file is skipped (like |-n|).
    User |shada| is loaded (unless "-i NONE" is given).

              *-b*

--headless  Start without UI, and do not wait for `nvim_ui_attach`. The
    builtin TUI is not used, so stdio works as an arbitrary
    communication channel. |channel-stdio|

    Also useful for scripting (tests) to see messages that would
    not be printed by |-es|.

    To detect if a UI is available, check if |nvim_list_uis()| is
    empty during or after |VimEnter|.

    To read stdin as text, "-" must be given explicitly:
    --headless cannot assume that stdin is just text. >
      echo foo | nvim --headless +"%print" +"q!" -
<
    See also |--embed|.
    See also |-es|, which also disables most messages.

-V[N]   Verbose.  Sets the 'verbose' option to [N] (default: 10).
    Messages will be given for each file that is ":source"d and
    for reading or writing a ShaDa file.  Can be used to find
    out what is happening upon startup and exit.
    Example: >
      nvim -V8

-V[N]{filename}
    Like -V and set 'verbosefile' to {filename}.  Messages are not
    displayed; instead they are written to the file {filename}.
    {filename} must not start with a digit.
    Example: >
      nvim -V20vimlog
<
              *-D*
-D    Debugging.  Go to debugging mode when executing the first
    command from a script. |debug-mode|



autocmd FileType c          nnoremap <buffer> <C-]> :YcmCompleter GoTo<CR>

## PulseAudio and Alsa relationship
https://i.stack.imgur.com/IJkHa.png
ALSA is the kernel level sound mixer, it manages your sound card directly. ALSA by itself can only handle one application at a time. Of course, there is 'dmix', which was written to solve this problem. (It's an ALSA module.)
PulseAudio is a software mixer, on top of the userland (like you'd run an app). When it runs, it uses Alsa - without dmix - and manages every kind of mixing, the devices, network devices, everything by itself.
In 2014, you can still run only ALSA. But unless you compile your applications for yourself and enable ALSA support everywhere - or use a source-based distribution like Gentoo - you might get mixing problems. Pre-compiled applications that distros ship are usually only built with support for Pulseaudio, not pure ALSA. Ubuntu for example prefers PulseAudio. It comes with PulseAudio by default, so every application is compiled to only use PulseAudio.
PulseAudio does have its benefits. People say that it is good for working with audio across a network, and it solves some issues with multi-channel audio streams that happened under pure ALSA. It's also supposedly easier to develop apps for PA. On the end-user side of things, it's easy to select new devices, to control volume by app, etc.
However, in the default configuration it adds a not insignificant amount of latency into the mix. This is a big con for certain types of tasks that require low latency like some games and software.
OSS is an alternative to both of these, but it's not licensed under the GPL, which makes it not likely to see a lot of adoption by distros.

Illustration:
Typical PulseAudio-powered sound systems, like Ubuntu:

Kernel: ALSA -> Userland: PulseAudio -> app1, app2, app3
In the typical Linux system, PulseAudio mixes audio from all your different apps and feeds them up the chain to ALSA.
ALSA:

Kernel: ALSA -> dmix -> Userland: app1, app2, app3
With just pure ALSA, you need dmix to mix multiple apps. Without it, ALSA can only play an audio stream from one app at a time.
OSS:

Kernel: OSS -> Userland: app1, app2, app3
With OSS, the userland apps talk directly to OSS in the kernel, which mixes the streams itself.
So to sum up, in your typical system these days, ALSA talks directly to your sound cards, and Pulseaudio talks to your apps and programs and feeds that into ALSA.

## Fontconfig



Modern typography provides technologies for tweaking various aspects of the font’s presentation. The general idea is to make the typeface flexible enough for adapting to a variety of typographic requirement. Common features include tabular numerals, stylistic alternatives for select glyphs (e.g. slashed zero), ligatures, small caps, ordinal figures. Each font family will have support for its own classes.

GNU/Linux users can access these features by leveraging the fontconfig library’s rule declaration. There may be differences between distros on where the system-wide defaults are placed. But user-specific settings should normally be defined at ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d. Here is an overview of my current settings (see my dotfiles):

.config/fontconfig/conf.d/
├── 10-hinting-full.conf
├── 10-sub-pixel-rgb.conf
├── 11-lcdfilter-default.conf
├── 20-unhint-small-hack.conf
├── 45-generic.conf
├── 45-latin.conf
├── 50-enable-terminus.conf
├── 60-generic.conf
├── 60-latin.conf
├── 80-alegreya-fontfeatures.conf
├── 80-alegreya-sans-fontfeatures.conf
├── 80-condensed-large-dejavu.conf
├── 80-firago-fontfeatures.conf
└── README
The numbering matters as it determines the sequence for loading these rules. This is what Debian provides on the matter:

conf.d/README

Each file in this directory is a fontconfig configuration file. Fontconfig scans this directory, loading all files of the form [0-9][0-9].conf. 
These files are normally installed in /usr/share/fontconfig/conf.avail and then symlinked here, allowing them to be easily installed and then enabled/disabled by adjusting the symlinks.

The files are loaded in numeric order, the structure of the configuration has led to the following conventions in usage:

Files begining with:	Contain:
00 through 09		Font directories
10 through 19		system rendering defaults (AA, etc)
20 through 29		font rendering options
30 through 39		family substitution
40 through 49		generic identification, map family->generic
50 through 59		alternate config file loading
60 through 69		generic aliases, map generic->family
70 through 79		select font (adjust which fonts are available)
80 through 89		match target="scan" (modify scanned patterns)
90 through 99		font synthesis
Rules are written in XML. See this spec for all available constructs.

Trying things out
Now on to implementing our newfound knowledge! Say you have downloaded FiraGO and placed a directory containing its font files somewhere it can be read by your operating system. Font files can end in either .otf or .ttf. On Debian, user-specific typefaces are read from ~/.local/share/fonts. So FiraGO would be like this:

.local/share/fonts/FiraGO
├── FiraGO-BoldItalic.otf
├── FiraGO-Bold.otf
├── FiraGO-Italic.
└── FiraGO-Regular.otf
Then inside the local conf.d we add 80-firago-fontfeatures.conf, which contains the following:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
  <description>Enable select opentype features for FiraGO.</description>

  <!--
	  Typographic features are provided on a per-typeface basis.
	  Tables with all available features are available here:
	  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType_feature_tag_list 

      Also read the fontconfig user spec:
      https://www.freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig/fontconfig-user.html
  -->

  <match target="font">
    <test name="family" compare="eq" ignore-blanks="true">
      <string>FiraGO</string>
    </test>
    <edit name="fontfeatures" mode="append">
      <string>tnum on</string> <!-- tabular numbers -->
      <string>zero on</string> <!-- slashed zero -->
    </edit>
  </match>
</fontconfig>

 prettier-ignore
 '/etc/fonts/local.conf'.
 <!-- By default fontconfig get the DPI value from ~/.Xresources -->
 <match target="font">
   <edit name="antialias" mode="assign">
      <bool>false</bool>
   </edit>
   <edit name="autohint" mode="assign">
     <bool>false</bool>
   </edit>
   <edit name="hinting" mode="assign">
     <bool>true</bool>
   </edit>
   <edit mode="assign" name="hintstyle">
     <const>hintfull</const>
   </edit>
   <edit mode="assign" name="lcdfilter">
    <const>none</const>
  </edit>
 </match>
```

Focus on the part inside of the <edit> tags. This is where we toggle the features that FiraGO supports (as documented in its download page). As you can see, I only need tabular numbers and a slashed zero. This makes FiraGO far better as a UI font, while not detracting from its already superb ability to present body copy.

To target another font family, simply replace “FiraGO” from this part: <string>FiraGO</string>. I have tried this method with a number of typefaces, all delivering the expected results.

Pro tip: combine FiraGO with Fira Code (apt install fonts-firacode) for a consistent typographic experience across your desktop environment.
