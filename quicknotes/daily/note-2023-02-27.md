consider something like your not drop down as a quick editor to send to console

Colors
console should be all black, higher contrast on major elements but not too bright


** Keys for devconsole

C-F/C-B should fast scroll for elemnents, console, network, sourcesa
C-F/C-B should fast scroll on Ctrl-P menu
j/k should scroll on elements, network
ctrl-n/p should scroll network requests, not sure abou console,
Add '/' searching, turn off with escape, style it more prominent
':' should open Ctrl-P menu
console panel should be 'C-S-[' instead of just C-[

how should we manage moving into side element panels, and the many console submenus?

focus on ease of navigation of elements panel, some kind of filtering?
also focus on interacting with styles panel from vim

shortcut on network list to copy menu
