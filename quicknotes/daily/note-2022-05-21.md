```sh
# i3wm does not read .*rc (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc...) on startup. I have read in some places it may load up ~/.profile on startup, but it still might not know what to do with the variable.
# The i3 config can accept these variables locally without any problems; add them to the top of the config file with set $TERMINAL termite and then call it normally later such as `bindsym $mod+Enter exec $TERMINAL `
# In this case, your variables are defined in the startup of i3, and it knows what it's looking for no problem.
# Alternatively, you can write a wrapper; Here's a one-liner to paste in your Terminal that should work.

  echo -e '#!/usr/bin/sh \nTERMINAL=termite \nsh -c "$TERMINAL"' > execTerm.sh && chmod +x execTerm.sh
# Then, insert the script into the i3 config:
  bindsym $mod+Enter exec /home/$USER/execTerm.sh
```

The -e on echo makes it identify backslash escape sequences, so \n is a newline without anything special done to the text format. It all gets pasted (overwritten) into a file called execTerm.sh and then it is made executable with chmod. Just remember that i3 likes absolute paths to these custom scripts in the config.
