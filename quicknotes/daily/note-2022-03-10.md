create a financial report that can be run based on daily, weekly, monthly or custom date ranges.
The report will contain the following data:

Date of Service
Time of Service
Provider Name
Customer Name
Number of times Customer has used SpaDash
Number of Days since last servide
Service Type      Service Price  (*N for number of services provided in appointment)
Commission % rate (65%, 75%, 95% etc.)
Provider payout for travel
Provider payout for service(s)
Total Provider Payout
SpaDash Payout

The report should sort and list these by date or by provider
At the end of eadh provider should be each of these for the report period-

Total Provider payout for travel
Total Provider payout for service(s)
Grand Total Provider Payout
At the bottom of the report should be a cumulative total
Total SpaDash payout for Travel
Total SpaDash Payout for services
Grand Total SpaDash payout

Great! Our technical discussion will be broken up into 3 parts:
  -backend architecture
  -databases
  -Go questions

You're allowed to prepare notes for the discussion but you should demonstrate technical understanding
of these topics and not just reading comprehension.
The backend architecture section goes over different decisions and technologies
that are used in designing backend services.
You’ll be asked to talk about different ways that services can communicate with each other,
especially considering resilience and type-safety, how services can be monitored and deployed,
and controlling infrastructure spend.

Additionally, you should familiarize yourself with different database options that are commonly used in the Cloud.
You’re not expected to have in-depth knowledge about any particular database but instead you’ll
be asked about the high-level differences between different database models and what applications
they’re best suited for. Here are links to some popular databases:

MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/)
PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org/)
Redis (https://redis.io/)
ClickHouse (https://clickhouse.com/)
Snowflake (https://www.snowflake.com/)
Prometheus (https://prometheus.io/)
BoltDB (https://github.com/boltdb/bolt)
Cassandra (https://cassandra.apache.org/)
BigQuery (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)
DGraph (https://dgraph.io/)

Finally, the Go-specific questions are about the Go language itself and the unique Go features.
If you’ve never used Go before, the Go Tour (https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1) encompasses all that is necessary for our discussion.
You’re not expected to write any Go code or recite method names but you’ll be asked about primitives and high-level features and how they compare to languages you might be more familiar with.

Thanks! Looking forward to our discussion!
