And crucially, what exact mpc command did you use to add tracks? Because the log you provided does not show any MPD connections being made to Mopidy.
Are you aware you have decided to configure Mopidy’s MPD frontend to listen on the non-standard port 6681? If you configure Mopidy like that then you MUST specify that same non-standard port when using mpc else you won’t be talking to Mopidy, you’ll be talking to whatever is listening at the default MPD protocol port 6600. The only other software that normally listens on port 6600 is mpd and mpd does not know anything about Spotify.
So:
If you are not using mpd, save yourself some headaches by uninstalling mpd and reconfiguring Mopidy’s MPD frontend to use port 6600. Then your regular mpc commands above will work.
If you are using mpd, realise it’s entirely separate to Mopidy. If you want to use both Mopidy’s MPD frontend and mpd on the same machine, that’s fine, but make sure you specify the correct port when using an MPD client such as mpc. e.g. mpc -p 6681 add spotify:blah:blah.
