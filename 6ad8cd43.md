    Failed payment attempt:

    -   Hi John, Jeremy from SpaDash again. I'm reaching out because we ran into
        some problems processing your payment for your appointment today. I am
        seeing a decline message with no further details besides to reach out to
        your bank. Since you just signed up yesterday I'm guessing we don't have
        an out of date card, but if you do need to add a new card you can do
        that on the Profile screen in the app. If you don't mind, let me know
        when you speak with your bank or add a new card so it's ready for me to
        retry. Thanks!
    -   one-time/retry-payment
    -   to complete appointment: auth0 become provider, log into app, complete
        appointment there

-   Force new appointment:

    -   switch UUID of personal auth0 to customer id, create new appointment
        with anyone at same/similar day and time
    -   assign correct provider id, adjust duration if needed
    -   one-time/prepare-appointments to reset drive distances

-   Canceled appointments:

    -   If provider wants to keep appointments but cancel future ones, just mark
        shift as cancelled.
    -   Providers shouldn't cancel appointment if within 24 hours, they should
        call us:
    -   If within 24 hours and cancel appointment
        -   /one-time/availability: takes appointment_id, change parameters to
            see if anyone else can cover it
        -   just assign if it's within usual, get jeremy to make sure text goes
            out
        -   if it's a far drive, ask for favor and bump up fee for their drive
        -   if we find someone, or if they have doctors note, no fee
    -   If can't find someone, create a promo code depending on how mad/screwed
        they are
        -   Tell them next availabilities for specific provider or all
            providers, or they can use the app to reschedule.
        -   Send text first, double check before their canceled appointment that
            they understand.
```

    INSERT INTO spadash_api.appointment_services (uuid, appointment_id, service_type_id, recipient_name, recipient_gender, recipient_type_id, service_notes, service_status, service_fee_usd) VALUES (
      uuid_generate_v4(), 1164, 8, 'Adam - Nick Added', 2, 2, '', 'pending', 4500
    );

```
    To add a service for an existing (in process) appointment:
    -   Lookup appointment and invoice id
    -   Create a new service associated with the appointment_id
    -   Update appointment invoice: discounted servies, services cost, provider
        payout
    -   Create a new payment intent with stripe (onetime/fix-and-retry-payment)
    -   Update StripePaymentAttempts table with new payment attempt id For the
        services update for Shanah, I ran....
```

```sql
    INSERT INTO spadash_api.appointment_services (uuid, appointment_id, service_type_id, recipient_name, recipient_gender, recipient_type_id, service_notes, service_status, service_fee_usd) VALUES (
      uuid_generate_v4(), 3206, 2, 'Jeremy Added', 2, 1, '', 'pending', 2900
    );
    UPDATE spadash_api.appointment_invoices SET provider_payment_usd = 8505, discounted_services_cost_usd = 12150, services_cost_usd = 12150 WHERE appointment_id = 3206 AND id = 2396;
```

```
    Run ./onetime/fix-and-retry-payment/onetime.js with the appointment id set
    to create but not charge await fixAndRetryPayment(3206, true, false); Use id
    for payment intent created in last step

    ```sql
    [UPDATE](UPDATE) spadash_api.stripe_payment_intents SET payment_intent_id = 'pi_1IJ1KoD5gVlzpTEFEhMvx2wJ', updated_at = now() WHERE appointment_id = 3206;
    ```

    When we charge them, we basically take the discounted convenience and
    service fees (plus taxes, eventually) from invoices and run that total
    against the payment intent we have in stripe_payment_intents using the card
    on `spadash_api.appointments.stripe_payment_method_id`

-   Can't find appointment?
    -   Get lat,lng of appointment, check it against address in google maps
