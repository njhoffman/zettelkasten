# Vim Mappings and Notes

## Git within vim

- gD: Gdiffsplit, BCommits, :Gblame, ~ key
- Go to quickfix list, `<CR>` on the first version to diff - which opens up a fugitive split with that version.
- Go back to quickfix, yiw the hash of the version to diff against
- Navigate back to fugitive buffer of the first version, and `:Gvdiffsplit <C-r>0` (to paste the hash)

## Shortcut key mappings

## Multiple Cursors

- select words with Ctrl-N ,create cursors vertically with Ctrl-Down/Ctrl-Up, select one character at a time with Shift-Arrows
- press n/N to get next/previous occurrence, press [/] to select next/previous cursor, press q to skip current and get next occurrence
- press Q to remove current cursor/selection, start insert mode with i,a,I,A

Two main modes: press Tab to switch between «cursor» and «extend» mode
in cursor mode commands work as they would in normal mode, in extend mode commands work as they would in visual mode

Most vim commands work as expected (motions, r to replace characters, ~ to change case, etc). Additionally you can:
  run macros/ex/normal commands at cursors
  align cursors
  transpose selections
  add patterns with regex, or from visual mode
  And more... of course, you can enter insert mode and autocomplete will work.


## Remove everything except regex match (ClearAllButMatches)

```vim
" This effect can be accomplished by using sub-replace-special substitution and setreg() linewise
:let @a=""
:%s//\=setreg('A', submatch(0), 'l')/g
:%d _
:pu a
:0d _
 or all in one line as such:

:let @a=""|%s//\=setreg('A', submatch(0), 'l')/g|%d _|pu a|0d _
" Overview: Using a substitution to append each match into register "a" linewise then replace the entire buffer with the contents of register "a"

" Explanation:

" 1. let @a="" empty the "a" register that we will be appending into
" 2. %s//\=setreg('A', submatch(0), 'l')/g substitute globally using the last pattern
" 3. the \=expr will replace the pattern with the contents of the expression
" 4. submatch(0) get the entire string of what just matched
" 5. setreg('A', submatch(0), 'l') append (note: the capital "a") to @a the matched string, but linewise
" 6. %d _ delete every line into the black hole register (aka @_)
" 7. pu a put the contents of @a into the buffer
" 8. 0d _ delete the first line
"
" Concerns:
" This will trash one of your registers. This example trashed @a
" Uses the last search pattern. Although you can modify the substitute command with whatever pattern you want: %s/<pattern>/\=setreg('A', submatch(0), 'l')/g
```

### Yank and swap

```vim
yi[       " yank what's between the brackets
S         " delete line and start insert
<C-r>0    " insert last yanked text
```

### Non-greedy line replacing

Delete entire line and replace with matched subgroup
Assuming <ip> is your regex to match an IP address, I presume you could do something like:

```vim
:%s/.\{-}\(<ip>\).*/\1/g
:%s/\v.{-}(<ip>).*/\1/
```

### Using grep outside of vim

```vim
:1,$! grep --extended-regexp --only-matching --regexp="([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}"
:%!grep --only-matching --extended-regexp '".*"'
```

### Using macro with nowrapscan

```vim
:set nowrapscan
:let @a=""
gg0qac/\v(\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}<CR><CR><Esc>//e+1<CR>@aq@adG
```

1. set nowrapscan disables ability to seek «past the end of file».
2. let @a="": empty the a register.
3. gg0: go to the first column (0) of the first line (gg).
4. qa: start writing macros.
5. c/{pattern}<CR>: change until pattern.
6. c{motion}<CR><ESC>: replace text with newline (here {motion} is /{pat}<CR>).
7. //e+1<CR>: search for last pattern, go one character left past its end (wraps around a newline, but if your lines looks like this: IP<newline>IP, there may be problems).
8. @a: execute @a macros (it is empty when you are recording it, but when you are finished it will repeat steps 1-7 until it gets an error).
9. q: end recording @a.
10. @a: execute @a macros.
11. dG: delete to the end of file.


## Power of 'g'

```vim
# Display context (5 lines) for all occurrences of a pattern.
:g/pattern/z#.5
" Same, but with some beautification.
:g/pattern/z#.5|echo "=========="
# delete all lines matching a pattern
:g/pattern/d
# delete all lines NOT matching a pattern
:g!/pattern/d
:v/pattern/d
# Delete all blank lines (^ is start of line; \s* is zero or more whitespace characters; $ is end of line)
:g/^\s*$/d
# Double space the file (^ is start of line which matches each line).
:g/^/pu =\"\n\"
" Alternative (:put inserts nothing from the blackhole register)
:g/^/pu _
# Copy all lines matching a pattern to end of file.
:g/pattern/t$
# Move all lines matching a pattern to end of file.
:g/pattern/m$
# Copy all lines matching a pattern to register 'a'.
qaq:g/pattern/y A
# Explanation qaq is a trick to clear register a (qa starts recording a macro to register a, then q stops recording, leaving a empty). y A is an Ex command (:help :y). It yanks the current line into register A (append to register a).
# Increment each number at the start of a line, from the current line to end-of-file, by one (the exclamation mark in :normal! means this will work even if Ctrl-A has been mapped to perform a function other than its default of incrementing a number).
:.,$g/^\d/exe "normal! \<C-A>"
# Comment lines containing "DEBUG" statements in a C program.
" using :normal
g/^\s*DEBUG/exe "norm! I/* \<Esc>A */\<Esc>"
" using :substituting
g/^\s*DEBUG/s!.*!/* & */!
# Reverse lookup for records (say an address book, with Name at start-of-line and fields after a space).
:g/pattern/?^\w?p "if only name is interesting
:g/pattern/ka|?^\w?p|'ap "if name and the lookup-line is interesting
:g/pattern/?^\w?|+,/^[^ ]/-1p "if entire record is interesting
# Add text to the end of a line that begins with a certain string.
:g/^pattern/s/$/mytext
# Deleting many lines
# The command :g/pattern/d performs :d on all lines matching the pattern, see :help :delete. When a line is deleted, it is first copied to a register—since no register is specified, the default (unnamed) register is used. If many thousands of lines are deleted, the copy process can take a significant time. To avoid that waste of time, the blackhole register (_) can be specified because any copy or cut into the blackhole register performs no operation.
# Fast delete of all lines matching a pattern.
:g/pattern/d _
# Explanation See :help :range for the meaning of the constructs in the [cmd] portion of the :g commands.
# Reverse a file (just to show the power of g).
:g/^/m0
:2,8co15  "copy lines 2 through 8 after line 15
:4,15t$   "copy lines 4 through 15 to end of document (t == co)
:-t$      "copy previous line to end of document
:m0       "move current line to line 0 (i.e. the top of the document)
:.,+3m$-1 "current line through current+3 are moved to the lastLine-1 (i.e. next to last)
```
