* gD: Gdiffsplit, BCommits, :Gblame, ~ key
* Go to quickfix list, <CR> on the first version to diff - which opens up a fugitive split with that version.

* Navigate back to fugitive buffer of the first version, and :Gvdiffsplit <C-r>0 (to paste the hash)

|     key     |            vim action            |
|:-----------:|:--------------------------------:|
| $m+h +  c/v | i3 center or reset middle window |
|    $m-spc   |        tmux cycle layouts        |
|  $m-s $m-w  |       window/session picker      |


`gaip*|` => aligns table when selected
- Currently lookup consists of how2, cht.sh, then one liners with navi, then personal repository
- Need keys for ISwap


|    key    |         shell action       |
|:---------:|:--------------------------:|
|  C-f  C-F |     (insert) skip word     |
| C-a C-U/F |     highlight url/file     |
|   C-a f   |     butler search          |

| $m-spc       | tmux cycle layouts               |
| `$m+h` `c/v` | i3 center or reset middle window |
| `$m-s $m-w`  | window/session picker            |


*Multiple Cursors*
* select words with Ctrl-N ,create cursors vertically with Ctrl-Down/Ctrl-Up, select one character at a time with Shift-Arrows
* press n/N to get next/previous occurrence, press [/] to select next/previous cursor, press q to skip current and get next occurrence
* press Q to remove current cursor/selection, start insert mode with i,a,I,A

Two main modes: press Tab to switch between «cursor» and «extend» mode
in cursor mode commands work as they would in normal mode, in extend mode commands work as they would in visual mode

Most vim commands work as expected (motions, r to replace characters, ~ to change case, etc). Additionally you can:
  run macros/ex/normal commands at cursors
  align cursors
  transpose selections
  add patterns with regex, or from visual mode
  And more... of course, you can enter insert mode and autocomplete will work.
